#### Question #0
What is the time complexity of accessing the nth element on an unsorted array?

* [ ] O(n!)
* [ ] O(2^n)
* [ ] O(log(n))
* [ ] O(n)
* [X] O(1)
* [ ] O(nlog(n))
* [ ] O(n^2)

#### Question #1
What is the time complexity of removing at index n in an unsorted array?

* [ ] O(n!)
* [ ] O(2^n)
* [ ] O(log(n))
* [X] O(n)
* [ ] O(1)
* [ ] O(nlog(n))
* [ ] O(n^2)

#### Question #2
Assuming you have a pointer to the node to insert, what is the time complexity of inserting after the nth element of a doubly linked list?

* [ ] O(n!)
* [ ] O(2^n)
* [ ] O(log(n))
* [X] O(n)
* [ ] O(1)
* [ ] O(nlog(n))
* [ ] O(n^2)

#### Question #3
What is the time complexity of this function/algorithim?
```javascript
var factorial = function(n) {
    if(n == 0) {
        return 1
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}
```
* [ ] O(n!)
* [ ] O(2^n)
* [ ] O(log(n))
* [X] O(n)
* [ ] O(1)
* [ ] O(nlog(n))
* [ ] O(n^2)
